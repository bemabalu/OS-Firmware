# Version 1.1.0 Release Notes

It's finally here! The 1.1.0 release of OpenShock is now available for download.

This update is packed with some major enhancements and numerous improvements that we believe will improve your experience using your device.

From introducing seamless Over-The-Air updates, adding support for new hardware, to enhancing the overall functionality and stability of the system, we've worked hard to improve upon our last release.

We've also squashed some pesky bugs and made various minor updates to streamline and optimize your experience.

Here’s what’s new:

## Major Updates

- **OTA (Over-The-Air) Updates**:
  - Introduced a seamless OTA update capability, device can now be updated with the click of a button.
  - Features:
    - Updates can be triggered remotely via the OpenShock website.
    - Device can automatically check for updates at a configured interval.
    - Update state will be streamed back to frontend so you can see the status of your device in real time.
  - Provided an option to deactivate each of these features individually through the Captive Portal for users preferring manual control.
- **Support for OpenShock Core V1**: Added support for @nullstalgia custom PCB, which is [fully open-source](https://github.com/nullstalgia/OpenShock-Hardware/tree/main/Core).
- **Captive Behavior Enhancement**: Phones and PC's now prompt the user with the Captive Portal upon WiFi connection.
- **More serial commands**:
  - Read/Write configuration in JSON or raw binary format.
  - Shocker command execution via serial.
  - GPIO pin listing, excluding reserved pins.
  - Serial command echo support for terminals lacking this feature.
- **Reworked partitions:** Moved configuration into its own partition, ensuring it persists across updates
- **Reserved pins**:
  - Added support for reserved pins so users can no longer use reserved pins that might lead to ESP instability.
  - User will now receive an error upon trying to set anything to use these pins.
  - The available pins can be listed via the `AvailGPIO` serial command.
- **Shocker keepalive**:
  - Improved shocker responsiveness by sending keepalive messages to them at a interval.
  - This will prevent the shockers from entering sleep mode.
  - Has option to be disabled via the `keepalive` serial command.
- **Config Handler Overhaul**:
  - Rewrote config handler to be more modular and make it easier to expand upon the code base.
  - Each config section is now seperated into its own file and class.

## Minor Updates

- Firmware upload now includes an MD5 sum.
- Enhanced reliability of WiFi scanning.
- Status LEDs:
  - Reworked some code for LED pattern and state management.
  - Added support for WS2812B RGB (Gamer :sunglasses:) LEDs.
- Improved WiFi connectivity speed post-setup.
- Updated Captive Portal color palette.
- Dependency cleanup:
  - Removed ArduinoJSON
  - Removed nonstd/span
- Removed Arduino-style loop behaviors, replaced with freeRTOS tasks.

- CodeQL code quality checks integrated into CI/CD pipeline.
- Utilized filesystem partition hash as ETag for content caching.
- Improved logs to be more consise and verbose.
- Miscellaneous code cleanup, refactoring, and optimizations.

## Bug Fixes

- Resolved issue with WiFi scans getting stuck.
- Fixed connection problems with unsecured networks.
- Altered CommandHandler to use a queue kill message, preventing panic when deleting a mid-listening queue.

- Fixed updateID not being sent with BootStatus message.
- Make OTA update status reporting smoother.
- Fix what firmware boot type firmware reports to server.
- Reduced latency, allocations, and network traffic for reporting wifi network scan results, making the networks instantly available in the frontend and improving the reliability of the captive portal.
